# Transition guide for Netverify & Fastfill SDK

This section only covers the breaking technical changes that should be considered when updating from the previous version.

## 3.3.0
#### Deallocation callback
Added a new method [checkDeallocation](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/NetverifySDK.html#checkDeallocation-com.jumio.nv.NetverifyDeallocationCallback-) in the [NetverifySDK](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/NetverifySDK.html) to check if the SDK resources have already been deallocated. The method requires a  [NetverifyDeallocationCallback](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/NetverifyDeallocationCallback.html) instance as a parameter and calls `onNetverifyDeallocated` once the SDK is deallocated. The checkDeallocation method should only be called once the SDK has returned a result and another SDK instance is required.

#### Dependency change
*  ~~com.facetec:zoom-authentication-hybrid:7.0.12~~ is replaced by com.facetec:zoom-authentication-hybrid:7.0.14

#### Date changes
All dates are now UTC based. This affects the dates in [NetverifyDocumentData](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/NetverifyDocumentData.html) and [NetverifyCustomNfcAccess](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/nfc/custom/NetverifyCustomNfcAccess.html)

#### New SDK localizations added
SDK Translations for the languages Italian and Portuguese have been added.

## 3.2.1
#### Fixed a face scanning problem in which a black screen was shown to the user

## 3.2.0
#### Dependency change
*  ~~androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.0.0~~ is replaced by androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.0.2
*  ~~com.facetec:zoom-authentication-hybrid:7.0.9~~ is replaced by com.facetec:zoom-authentication-hybrid:7.0.12

#### API changes in NetverifyCustomScanInterface
A new parameter [NetverifyCancelReason](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/custom/NetverifyCancelReason.html) was added to [NetverifyCustomScanInterface$onNetverifyScanForPartCanceled](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/custom/NetverifyCustomScanInterface.html#onNetverifyScanForPartCanceled-com.jumio.core.data.document.ScanSide-NetverifyCancelReason-)

#### Watchlist Screening
Two new methods for handling watchlist screening have been added. Please refer to the [Netverify guide](/docs/integration_bam-checkout.md#watchlist-screening)
```
netverifySDK.setWatchlistScreening(NVWatchlistScreening.ENABLED);
netverifySDK.setWatchlistSearchProfile("YOURPROFILENAME");
```

#### Additional functions in NetverifyCustomScanInterface
For the new NFC scanning functionality in custom ui, there has been some additions in [NetverifyCustomScanInterface](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/custom/NetverifyCustomScanInterface.html):
`getNetverifyCustomNfcInterface()` should return an instance of [NetverifyCustomNfcInterface](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/nfc/custom/NetverifyCustomNfcInterface.html) or Null
`onNetverifyStartNfcExtraction(NetverifyCustomNfcPresenter)` is called when the NFC scanning can be started. The NFC scanning is controlled with the provided instance of [NetverifyCustomNfcPresenter](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/nfc/custom/NetverifyCustomNfcPresenter.html)

#### Customization
The following customization attribute have been added: `netverify_scanOverlayFill`

#### New Fastfill offline token required
Due to a license model update in our Barcode implementation, it's necessary to regenerate the offline token when updating to version 3.2.0  

#### Close button customization in custom ui
The position and image of the close button for face scanning can now be customized. Please have a look at the [NetverifyCustomScanView](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/custom/NetverifyCustomScanView.html)

#### Custom ui help animation support
[NetverifyCustomScanPresenter$getHelpAnimation](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/custom/NetverifyCustomScanPresenter.html#getHelpAnimation-com.jumio.nv.custom.NetverifyCustomAnimationView-) has been added to get the specific help animation in case the scan part is canceled. An instance of  [NetverifyCustomAnimationView](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/custom/NetverifyCustomAnimationView.html) needs to be passed where the animation is rendered in.

## 3.1.0

```

## 2.14.0
#### Migrate to AndroidX
The support library was migrated to [`AndroidX`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/). As the developer page outlines, this is a mandatory step since all new Support Library development and maintenance will occur in the AndroidX library. This [`migration guide`](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) shows you how to migrate your application to AndroidX.

Check out the changed dependencies in the  [`dependencies section`](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-android/blob/master/docs/integration_netverify-fastfill.md#dependencies) or in the [`build.gradle`](https://github.com/Jumio/mobile-sdk-android/blob/master/sample/JumioMobileSample/build.gradle) of the sample application.
The mapping for all support libraries is listed in section "Artifact mappings" [here](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate)

Dependencies that changed in the SDK:
+ com.android.support:appcompat-v7:27.1.1 -> androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.0.0
+ com.android.support:cardview-v7:27.1.1 -> androidx.cardview:cardview:1.0.0
+ com.android.support:design:27.1.1 -> com.google.android.material:material:1.0.0
- com.android.support:support-v4:27.1.1 -> androidx.legacy:legacy-support-v4:1.0.0 (was merged by AndroidX and can be therefore be fully removed)

#### Default Settings
The default values for [`requireVerification`](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/NetverifySDK.html#setRequireVerification-boolean-) and [`requireFaceMatch`](https://jumio.github.io/mobile-sdk-android/com/jumio/nv/NetverifySDK.html#setRequireFaceMatch-boolean-) were changed to `true`. Please make sure that they are explicitly set to false in case a scan in Fastfill mode should be performed.

## 2.13.0
#### API change in NetverifyDocumentData
The function `getMiddleName()` has been removed. If a middle name is available, it will be concatinated with the first name.

#### Removed deprecated ABIs mips, mips64 and armeabi
These ABIs were deprecated in recent NDK toolsets as mentioned here - https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/abis and are not used any more.

## 2.12.1
#### Fixed a problem in which the user could get stuck in the Selfie capturing process

## 2.12.0
#### Fallback for Google Vision not operational added
A fallback to manual image picker will now be used if Google Vision is not operational due to problems on the device. This guarantees the face workflow to be finished despite problems with the availablility of the Google Play services. Details are also described in [sub-chapter operationality](integration_netverify-fastfill.md#operationality).
The method `netverifySDK.isMobileVisionOperational` remains in the SDK but doesn't need to be checked now necessarily.

#### New SDK localizations added
In addition to English, the translations for the languages Chinese (Simplified), Dutch, Frensh, German and Spanish have been added.

#### Remove unused strings for localization
Along with the additional languages, we removed some Strings that were unused in the SDK. The following keys have been removed: `netverify_confirmation_snackbar_help_default`, `netverify_accessibility_select_your_country`, `netverify_accessibility_action_double_click`, `netverify_accessibility_select_your_country`, `netverify_scan_options_country_title`, `netverify_overlay_liveness_advice` and `netverify_scan_options_preselected_hint`.

#### Additional information method removed
SDK method `netverifySDK.setAdditionalInformation` has been removed.

#### New callback in NetverifyCustomScanInterface
`onNetverifyDisplayBlurHint()` was added for custom scan view.

## 2.11.0
#### New error scheme
The schema for `errorCode` changed and it's type is now String instead of Integer.

* If the dependencies `com.jumio.android:nv-liveness` and `com.jumio.android:nv-barcode-vision` are both used in the application, the following lines have to be added to the application tag in the AndroidManifest.xml to avoid merge issues.
```
<meta-data
			android:name="com.google.android.gms.vision.DEPENDENCIES"
			android:value="barcode, face"
			tools:replace="android:value"/>
```
